## Introduction

This is group **D18**'s project.

For the purposes of this project we are using the dataset ‚Äúüéπ Spotify Tracks Dataset‚Äù from Kaggle. This dataset consists of a large list of songs from the popular streaming platform Spotify, along with 20 parameters describing each track.

All of our code as well as our entire analysis can be found within the file [spotify_project.ipynb](/spotify_project.ipynb).
